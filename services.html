            <h3>American Home textile</h3>
            <h4>Front-end engineer</h4>
            <p>
                1. Designed and developed responsive websites with pixel-perfect precision (to 2px). Built semantic HTML structures and used the Sass preprocessor for maintainability and reusability. Collaborated with designers and product managers to optimize page structure, perform page reconstruction, and enhance user experience.
                <br>
                2. Implemented various optimizations and features, including server-side processing to generate images with subtle watermarks and tracking the time taken for site-wide requests.
                <br>
                3. Conducted keyword analysis and selection, optimizing for keywords by focusing on density, relevancy, and prominence. Improved the website's ranking on search engine results pages (SERP).

            <h4>Software enginee</h4>
            <p>
                1. Contributed to the development and maintenance of an integrated software platform using TypeScript, React, Node.js, GraphQL, and Tailwind CSS, from requirements gathering to final implementation.
                <br>
                2. Led the development of the membership application independently, including the user interface. Collaborated with the visual design team using Figma. Ensured compatibility with older browsers, building complete functionalities using either graceful degradation or progressive enhancement as needed.
                <br>
                3. Optimized initial page load time using dynamic import and code splitting technologies, loading specific modules only when needed. Reduced unnecessary asynchronous data requests and lazy-loaded non-visible components to minimize rendering blockages.
                <br>
                4. Compressed all images in the project using ImageOptim, achieving an average compression rate of 40%, significantly reducing page load time. Selected the optimal image format based on usage scenarios, such as using WebP.
